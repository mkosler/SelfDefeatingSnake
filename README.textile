h1. Self-defeating Snake!

h2. My GGJ 2012 game (even though I didn't attend...)

*Overview*
This is a Global Game Jam-"theme":http://globalgamejam.org/news/2012/01/27/and-ggj-2012-theme 
inspired game, that also tries to use the diversifier 
"I know what you did last...":http://globalgamejam.org/wiki/achievements-diversifiers.
You play as a snake that must eat food pellets. As you eat the food pellets,
your snake grows longer and longer. You lose the game by either hitting
yourself or the edge of the map.

This is the exact model for any normal game of Snake. However, mine has
an extra component to increase the difficult, and try to adhere to my 
chosen achievement. You have a countdown timer that, if it reaches 0, will
record your movement until you eat a new pellet, at which point a stationary
wall is created that lasts until the end of the game. You can add time to this
countdown by eating pellets, so the game becomes not only eat as many pellets
as possible, but do it fast or else.
